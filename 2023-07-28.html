<ul>
<li>It's friday and the behavioural health center is closed during my normal time slot
<ul>
<li>luckily the library is open and I can hang out here and code</li>
<li>I've been looking at cafes but not a lot of places have power and are not too crowded</li>
<li>I have social anxiety disorder so it's difficult to be around dense groups of people
<ul>
<li>downtown isn't so bad since the distribution of people is actually better due to large area</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Created a remote tunnel in vscode so I can edit from server from browser without installing vscode on local machine</li>
</ul>
