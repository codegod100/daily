*   I've been working on sqlite importer in agora-bridge repo.
*   agora-server now supports pushed nodes in PR
*   weird day because of monday holiday
*   I'm seeing people with sqlite databases with millions of records and reporting it's fast.
*   playing around with docker on gitpod.
    *   I have a sql docker image for agora-server and one for agora-bridge in feature branches.
    *   I have a third gitpod running a [docker compose repo](https://github.com/codegod100/unified/blob/master/compose.yml)
*   Really liking my setup where I have github actions build docker images automatically for me
*   Now running my compose beast at [agora.vera.pink](https://agora.vera.pink)
