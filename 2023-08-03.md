*   I had therapy yesterday it was good
    *   Although I'm always a little emotionally activated afterwards
*   I've been in this shelter for a couple days now and I'm starting to adjust to a new normal. We have daily groups where we check in with an emotion and a number on a scale of 1 to 10. 
*   I finally got my key card after 6 requests. It allows me to scan into the building. 
*   I talk to my case manager next week and hopefully we can make some progress on things to get me into more permanent housing
