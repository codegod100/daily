<li>discovered <a href="https://codeberg.org/kytta/share2fedi">https://codeberg.org/kytta/share2fedi</a> today, it's like tootbooster. Glad I'm not the only one with this idea</li>
<li>found <a href="https://github.com/midrissi/func-loc">https://github.com/midrissi/func-loc</a> today for finding the file location where function are defined.
<ul>
<li>useful for libraries where internals are hidden in node_modules folder</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>found <a href="https://github.com/gornostay25/svelte-adapter-bun">https://github.com/gornostay25/svelte-adapter-bun</a> which is nice, bun is still prerelease so some stuff isn't fleshed out yet</li>
<li>I'm trying a new tactic. I'm create a minimal docker image for build environment and then a separate docker image for actually building source.
<ul>
<li>e.g. I'm creating an environment for bun and then using that to run bun stuff rather than downloading bun and building source in one step</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TIL you can ping n number of times with ping -c N HOST</li>
