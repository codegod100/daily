*   Updating date on here
    *   Deployed to production, yay it works!
*   Got onto housing wait-list I was hoping for
*   I have therapy today
*   I'm trying to get a case manager at tpi
*   App idea
    *   Create organization then when user oauths create repo with user name, we can have agora pull all user repos from organization into an agora ostensibly with an API or something.Â 
    *   This would enable us to onboard new users to the agora with very low barrier and high degree of moderation control
