*   I think I caught a stomach bug or something
*   I've been reading a chapter a day of the miracle of mindfulness
*   Everyone here is really optimistic that I'll find housing
*   I've been hanging out with a friend and I'm not sure if we're dating because I don't wanna ruin our friendship because I'm literally crazy
*   I filed online for my military service record today. I hve a confirmation number that I check status. I'll check back in a week or so and see how it's going
    *   hopefully I can use my veteran status to get out of homelessness quicker
*   they clean the main area of the shelter between 3:30 and 4:30 so you have to leave or stay in your room. I started taking this time to go on a walk and take care of daily tasks outside since I have a tendency to hole up once I find a place and not leave
