<ul>
<li>Guru's birthday today</li>
<li>Sundays are weird because I have to leave the shelter at 7:30am which means I have more time to kill in the mornings</li>
<li>The city is so dead in the mornings, especially on the weekends. I can stand in the middle of the street downtown and no cars</li>
