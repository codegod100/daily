*   discovered [https://codeberg.org/kytta/share2fedi](https://codeberg.org/kytta/share2fedi) today, it's like tootbooster. Glad I'm not the only one with this idea

*   found [https://github.com/gornostay25/svelte-adapter-bun](https://github.com/gornostay25/svelte-adapter-bun) which is nice, bun is still prerelease so some stuff isn't fleshed out yet
*   I'm trying a new tactic. I'm create a minimal docker image for build environment and then a separate docker image for actually building source.
    *   e.g. I'm creating an environment for bun and then using that to run bun stuff rather than downloading bun and building source in one step
*   TIL you can ping n number of times with ping -c N HOST
*   TIL debian doesn't come preinstalled with ping
