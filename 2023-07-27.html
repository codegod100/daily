<ul>
<li>Created a new server with <a href="https://capsul.org/">capsul</a>

<li>vultr was getting kinda expensive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I've created an entirely web based setup. I have an ssh client and code editor all in the browser. I tried going serverless but it's nice to have a small VPS hence the capsul server</li>
