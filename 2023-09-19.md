*   First day of peer training today
    *   I have 80 hours of training this month
    *   I'm not a fan of class work but at least I get to help people
    *   I'm going to be working on the weekends after class. 40 something days ago I was living on the sidewalk
*   Hugginface javascript libraries are kinda lacking. good thing python is growing on me.
