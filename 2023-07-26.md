*   Updating date on here
    *   Deployed to production, yay it works!
*   Got onto housing wait-list I was hoping for
*   I have therapy today
*   I'm trying to get a case manager at tpi
*   App idea
    *   Create organization then when user oauths create repo with user name, we can have agora pull all user repos from organization into an agora ostensibly with an API or something.Â 
    *   This would enable us to onboard new users to the agora with very low barrier and high degree of moderation control
    *   Caveats
        *   Existing software already exists e.g. logseq
*   Todo
    *   Update agora.vera.pink
    *   Decrease resources on dirtbox for cost reasons
    *   Figure out if I can create something like caddy as a saas platform
    *   Add clone link to page header

*   Took my computer out of storage. Now I have something to work on in the cafes and maybe I won't be so bored during the day.
