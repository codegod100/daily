*   I'm starting to get kinda stir crazy. I'm in this weird limbo where I'm not in proper housing and I'm not on the street. I'm learning how to have patience and trust the process. Having mental illnes makes it frustrating where I can't just get up and getÂ  job and house. I feel like after I make it through this process I will probably be setup for stability for the future. We'll see.
*   I'm trying to create a routine again. Now that I'm not on the street my day is totally different and I need to figure out a way to keep me sane while I'm in this holding pattern
