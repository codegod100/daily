</ul>
</li>
<li>Got onto housing wait-list I was hoping for</li>
<li>I have therapy today</li>
<li>I'm trying to get a case manager at tpi</li>
<li>App idea
<ul>
<li>Create organization then when user oauths create repo with user name, we can have agora pull all user repos from organization into an agora ostensibly with an API or something.&nbsp;</li>
<li>This would enable us to onboard new users to the agora with very low barrier and high degree of moderation control</li>
<li>Caveats
<ul>
<li>Existing software already exists e.g. logseq</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Todo
<ul>
<li>Update agora.vera.pink</li>
<li>Decrease resources on dirtbox for cost reasons</li>
<li>Figure out if I can create something like caddy as a saas platform</li>
<li>Add clone link to page header</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Took my computer out of storage. Now I have something to work on in the cafes and maybe I won't be so bored during the day.</li>
