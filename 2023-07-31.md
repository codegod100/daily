*   The beginning of the day in UTC is the end of the day local time
*   I set the date to UTC for technical reasons but I kinda like that it switches the same for everyone regardless of the timezone. I always thought it was weird that people had to operate at different timezones because of sunlight. I mean it's not weird it's just inconvenient for a worldwide system
*   I'm currently writing this on a street car that loops the downtown metro area to kill time. I can't check into the shelter I'm staying at until 9pm and the library closes at 6pm so I usually have to find a way to kill time in the evenings
*   It's Monday morning here and I called my bank to see why my account was closed. It turns out that one of the accounts linked to my login has been negative for greater than 45 days so they closed the account. Apparently this means that they disable the login for all the accounts because capitalism. Once I get a payment come through I'm planning on paying off the negative balance of the now-closed account so I can regain access to my bank login. Yay capitalism
*   I got accepted into a nice shelter funded by the county. I have my own private room and they're going to assign me a case manager. I have my laptop now with a private locker to store it in so I can work on more open source projects.
*   I'm really grateful that I have so many things going for me. I've seen some things out here that will forever change how I view my own circumstances.
