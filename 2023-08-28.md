*   Feeling kinda down this last week. I missed satsang today
*   Talked to case manager about housing stuff. She put me in her calendar to meet weekly
*   I'm going to worksource tomorrow to see about some opportunities
*   using [javy](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/javy) to compile js to wasm
    *   handy for functions that I want on multiple platforms like parsers where I don't want to rewrite the parser grammer in a slightly different dialect on each platform
