<ul>
<li>It's friday and the behavioural health center is closed during my normal time slot
<ul>
<li>luckily the library is open and I can hang out here and code</li>
<li>I've been looking at cafes but not a lot of places have power and are not too crowded</li>
<li>I have social anxiety disorder so it's difficult to be around dense groups of people
<ul>
<li>downtown isn't so bad since the distribution of people is actually better due to large area</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Created a remote tunnel in vscode so I can edit server from browser without installing vscode on local machine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The problem with "edge functions" is that they are a form of vendor lockin. I'm playing with supabase and it's cool but what happens when I want to move to another provider that has a completely different api?</li>
<li>The lights in this library are shining directly into my eyes. I think it's for the drug addicts that come in here to try and keep them awake.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>There needs to be systemic change in the USA.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
