*   It's friday and the behavioural health center is closed during my normal time slot
    *   luckily the library is open and I can hang out here and code
    *   I've been looking at cafes but not a lot of places have power and are not too crowded
    *   I have social anxiety disorder so it's difficult to be around dense groups of people
        *   downtown isn't so bad since the distribution of people is actually better due to large area
