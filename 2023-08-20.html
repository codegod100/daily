<ul>
<li>setup journal.vera.pink on railway.app which is a cool platform for managing deployment to different environments. it automates a docker container and automatically runs build toolchain on changes. The starter version is like 5 bucks a month. Look pretty cool. Might use it for a few things</li>
<li>tootbooster.com is now running on railway</li>
<li>sveltekit + railway is a pretty awesome setup.&nbsp;</li>
<li>I'm waiting for <a href="https://bun.sh/">bun </a>to reach 1.0 It's such a fast runtime</li>
