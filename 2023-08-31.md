*   My first day on fourth floor today
*   Got called by impact nw which is an organizations for veterans facing homelessnes. I'm meeting them at their office on Wednesday. It's interfering with a job fairÂ  I wanted to do. We'll see how it goes.
    *   I might reschedule depending on how I feel as it gets closer. They're just gonna do an intake so I feel like it could be pretty flexible.
*   I've been trying my hand at zig development lately. For the most part I like high level languages (javascript being my favorite), but sometimes it's fun to dig into the internals of things.
    *   zig is oriented to replace c by using the c ecosystem as opposed to rust which is trying to create its own.
    *   the memory management model of zig feels a lot closer to c
*   Found [pdm](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm) for python today it's like poetry but feels more sleek and easier to use
