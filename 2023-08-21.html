<ul>
<li>realizing that subnode content may exceed mastodon message limit.
<ul>
<li>gave me an idea to return error message on tootbooster on fail</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>working on an idea I'm calling structured links
<ul>
<li>basically instead of having well defined structure on objects in a graph, the objects are simple while the links between them are well structured</li>
<li>based on ontic structural realism where objects don't even exist. only our relationships between them are real</li>
<li>for example lets say I look at a bottle of orange juice. my experience is that it's orange, but what I'm really experiencing is the light between me and the orange juice hitting my eyes.
<ul>
<li>the taste is the same thing, it's the molecules in the orange juice interacting with my taste receptors chemically.</li>
<li>orange juice looks and tastes like it does because we can have a shared universe of discourse because animals have similar sense organs and therefore similar sense experiences</li>
</ul>
