<li>I deleted Instagram off my phone. Was too much drama. I'm kinda over social
<ul>
<li>I'm still a fan of the fediverse though because I see that more as an information network than social media</li>
</ul>

<li>Feeling a little sick. Hopefully it gets better</li>
<li>working on a project I'm naming tootbooster, the premise is that it allows any website to point to a single site so you can rebroadcast content, kinda like twitter intents or matrix.to</li>
