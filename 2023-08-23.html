<ul>
<li>I'm trying a new tactic. I'm create a minimal docker image for build environment and then a separate docker image for actually building source.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>e.g. I'm creating an environment for bun and then using that to run bun stuff rather than downloading bun and building source in one step</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TIL you can ping n number of times with ping -c N HOST</li>
<li>TIL debian doesn't come preinstalled with ping</li>
</ul>
