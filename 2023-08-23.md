*   I'm trying a new tactic. I'm create a minimal docker image for build environment and then a separate docker image for actually building source.
*   *   e.g. I'm creating an environment for bun and then using that to run bun stuff rather than downloading bun and building source in one step
*   TIL you can ping n number of times with ping -c N HOST
*   TIL debian doesn't come preinstalled with ping
