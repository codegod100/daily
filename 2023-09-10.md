*   Been using gitpod a lot for development
    *   It's nice because the machines are so big and good internet
    *   They are ephemeral systems so you don't have to worry about machine specific unintentional dependencies
        *   Is a thing a lot of the time in VPS environments
*   Started playing Starfield
    *   pretty cool game, nice gameplay and graphics.
