<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Busy day today (yesterday) beginning of new UTC Day but still previous day locally</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Made a list of things I want to get done. Was satisfying to write it down. I've been using a paper journal someone gave to me</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Been writing some code lately. I don't have a desk so it's a bit straining but it also limits my time on the computer which is probably actually good for me in a lot of ways</li>
