*   Guru's birthday today
*   Sundays are weird because I have to leave the shelter at 7:30am which means I have more time to kill in the mornings
*   The city is so dead in the mornings, especially on the weekends. I can stand in the middle of the street downtown and no cars
*   my bank has denied access to me via online banking but it's a credit union and they're closed on the weekends so I have to wait until tomorrow to see what the issue is.
    *   hopefully it's not anything too bad
*   I got accepted into the shelter above the resource center I visit. They want me to check in with them tomorrow. We'll see how it goes.
