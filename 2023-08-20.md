*   setup journal.vera.pink on [railway.app](https://railway.app/) which is a cool platform for managing deployment to different environments. it automates a docker container and automatically runs build toolchain on changes. The starter version is like 5 bucks a month. Look pretty cool. Might use it for a few things
*   tootbooster.com is now running on railway
*   sveltekit + railway is a pretty awesome setup.Â 
*   I'm waiting for [bun](https://bun.sh/) to reach 1.0 It's such a fast runtime
