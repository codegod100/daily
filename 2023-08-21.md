*   realizing that subnode content may exceed mastodon message limit.
    *   gave me an idea to return error message on tootbooster on fail
*   working on an idea I'm calling structured links
    *   basically instead of having well defined structure on objects in a graph, the objects are simple while the links between them are well structured
    *   based on ontic structural realism where objects don't even exist. only our relationships between them are real
    *   for example lets say I look at a bottle of orange juice. my experience is that it's orange, but what I'm really experiencing is the light between me and the orange juice hitting my eyes.
        *   the taste is the same thing, it's the molecules in the orange juice interacting with my taste receptors chemically.
        *   orange juice looks and tastes like it does because we can have a shared universe of discourse because animals have similar sense organs and therefore similar sense experiences
