<ul>
<li>Guru's birthday today</li>
<li>Sundays are weird because I have to leave the shelter at 7:30am which means I have more time to kill in the mornings</li>
<li>The city is so dead in the mornings, especially on the weekends. I can stand in the middle of the street downtown and no cars</li>
<li>my bank has denied access to me via online banking but it's a credit union and they're closed on the weekends so I have to wait until tomorrow to see what the issue is.
<ul>
<li>hopefully it's not anything too bad</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I got accepted into the shelter above the resource center I visit. They want me to check in with them tomorrow. We'll see how it goes.</li>
<li>Been thinking about writing a book to pass the time. I think I can create an outline about what I want to write about and then just fill in the chapters until I reach a couple hundred pages. Thinking about maybe using AI to help me.</li>
